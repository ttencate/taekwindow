What is Taekwindow?
===================

Taekwindow is a simple, lightweight and free Windows program that allows you to move and resize windows by dragging them with the Alt key, similar to many X11 window managers.

Why would I want it?
====================

If you're a Linux or other Unix user, you are probably familiar with Alt-dragging. Once you have gotten used to it, you'll want to use it in Windows as well.

But even if you're not used to Alt-dragging, it can still make your Windows experience more pleasant. Especially when you have a large monitor, or multiple monitors, you're moving your mouse much more than you ought to. Taekwindow can save you time, frustration and RSI!

What exactly does it do?
========================

In full detail, Taekwindow allows you to do the following:

* move a window by grabbing it _anywhere_ (not just the title bar) while holding the Alt key, and then dragging with the left mouse button;
* resize a window by grabbing it _anywhere_ (not just the tiny little border) while holding the Alt key, and then dragging with the right mouse button;
* move a maximized window between monitors by Alt-dragging;
* use the scroll wheel on the window under the cursor, instead of the currently focused window;
* push a window to the background by middle-clicking on its title bar.

All these features can be configured to your liking.

I'm convinced. How do I get it?
===============================

Taekwindow is completely free. It is a tiny download, and does not require installation: you can be running it only seconds from now.
